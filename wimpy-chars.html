    <h1>Characters</h1><!-- 12 -->
    <h2>Gregory Heffley</h2><!-- 13 -->
    <p>The main character, <strong>Greg</strong>, has trouble with family, friends, and his local middle school. He tries to fit in in his neighborhood and usually does not succeed. Facing many troubles, <strong>Greg</strong> attempts to handle them very creatively, but unfortunately his antics often backfire on him.</p>

    <p> <strong>Greg</strong> is selfish, lazy, cocky, arrogant, greedy, egotistical, usually backstabbing, and sometimes even cruel and dishonest, who apparently lacks talent. </p>

    <p>He hardly has any skills aside from video games, and possibly singing. However, despite all this,  <strong>Greg</strong> still has had his kind and caring moments, it's just that, it's not that often.</p>

    <p>He hates taking blame for anything, and would much rather take all the credit.</p>

    <h2>Rowley Jefferson</h2>
    <p>Greg's best friend. He is always willing to do what Greg tells him and is going on vacations all the time, which annoys Greg. <strong>Rowley</strong> is a loyal friend from lots of people's perspectives.</p>
    <p>Rowley is quite immature and seems a bit naive, but he has a charming, cheerful and innocence made him more popular with other students (particularly the girls) than Greg had.</p>
